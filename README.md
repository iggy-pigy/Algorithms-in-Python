## Note

This is a part of what I learned in an online course **Introduction to Computer Science & Programming Using Python** offered by **MIT** on **edX**.

## Testing

For testing a code I use *unittest* which has been built into the Python standard library. *unittest* contains both a testing framework and a test runner.

## Getting started

To run this code you need **Python3**.
