##Note:
####This is a part of what I learned in an online course **Introduction to Computer Science & Programming Using Python** offered by **MIT** on **edX**.

##Testing:
####For testing code I use *unittes* which is built into Python. *unittest* contains both a testing framework and a test runner.
